## About 

The VR Mental Rotation test is a project that was born at the [MIT STEP Lab](https://education.mit.edu/) where I worked with the [Collaborative Learning Environments in Virtual Reality](https://education.mit.edu/project/clevr/) Team to create this research project under the supervision of Dr. Meredith Thompson, PhD. 
 

The VR-MRT is a virtual reality application that aims to  reproduce the popular mental rotation test created by Shepard and Metzler's in 1971, but rather than using paper to test spatial abilities, we use virtual reality headsets.

## Installation
Installing this experience is pretty straight forward, clone this repo by running: 

```
git clone https://github.com/BrianLRamirez/VR-MRT.git
```

This project was developed for the Oculus Quest on Unity so youâ€™ll need to make sure you have Unity installed. In the root of the source code folder there is a file called `Build.apk`, you can side load this app into any Oculus Quest and start using the VR experience in no time. 

If you would like to edit the experience to better fit your research, then you will need to build the project with Unity. This project was built with `Unity Version 2019.1.14f.1` so we recommend you download this version of unity to avoid build errors.
